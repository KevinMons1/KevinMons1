## Hello ! I am Kévin Monsieur and I am a frontend web developper 💻😍

I am currently 21 years old and I know de world of coding since my 15 years old 🎉

I am passionate about Javascript and beautiful **designs to integrate**. I love animations and break my brain to create them 🧠🤯

I am currently in the BeCode bootcamp, so every project with the name "BeCode..." is a project created for [BeCode](https://becode.org/ "BeCode") solo or in group

**My prefer technologies are**
- React.js (+ Next.js) ❤️
- Three.js + PixiJS 🛠
- Animation (GSAP, Framer-motion, React-spring, SASS animations) 🌈

**I also known**
- Node.js
- SQL
- Socket.io 

Have a nice trip in my Github, I advise you the pinned projects 😀
